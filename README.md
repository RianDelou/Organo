# About the project
<p>The main objective of Organo is to organize teams in each area. I developed this based on a game called Valorant, which has many professional teams.</p>
<p>Valorant has many maps to play on, and each map has a specific composition that fits it best.</p>
<p>With Organo, you can organize your team by selecting the agent for each person and each map. Organo will make the composition more organized and visually appealing! 
access the website and try it ^^</p>
<p>I developed Organo using React.js.</p>
